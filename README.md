## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Marnix van Woudenberg and I am a teacher at the Christelijk Lyceum Delft. Here I teach Computer Science and Digital Skills. I like this very much, because it's both technical given my background and social to work with young people. The dynamics at school are alwyas new and refreshing, this keeps me sharp.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Christelijk Lyceum Delft
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to teach Digital Skills the best way
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Computer Science with Thom
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with teaching first year students in puberty
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my hobbies
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: via e-mail of school
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: Master of Science
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love playing the piano and try to learn to violin
